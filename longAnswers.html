<p>Nowadays, programming is everywhere. And I do believe that it is something everybody should know
  and deal with. To do so, it must be accessible.One of MIT App Inventor goal is to allows everyone,
   even novices, to experience and create fully functional apps. And that's a mission i care about.

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Interest in App Inventor</h3>

<p>As a Mathematics and Computer science tutor at Polytechnic School of Montreal, my task is
  to help novices students who are uncomfortable with the basics of programmation, to better
  understand the materials covered in following classes: Procedural programming in C++ (INF1500C),
   Object-oriented programming in C++ (INF1010)..
</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Proposed summer project.</h3>

<p>CDK (Component Developer Kit) is a project i find very interesting seeing that it will add
  more flexibility to the system. Sometime, users specifically experienced one, are stuck during
   there development because a feature they want to use is unavailable as a component.
   Having a Component Developer Kit will allow them to build their apps more efficiently.
   Furthermore, this can be a starting point for an open plugin store where developers can submit
    created components. This will allow users to have more choices when selecting a component and
    will allow them to create more diverse apps.
</p>
<p>However, this a task with multiple challenges seeing that it will increase the system complexity.
   All components created by users can work alone but interactions can sometimes cause a problem.
</p>

<p>I like working on challenging project like this one because that allow me to gain additional skills and make me discover my real potential. Otherwise, i am open to another project if the mentor thinks that it will be more suitable for my profile.

<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Experience with development tools.</h3>

<h4>Java</h4>
<p>I've took more than 3 adavanced computer science courses where the main programming language was
   Java. I'm dealing also with java when i'm crafting some Android apps. I am also using Java in my
   research internship.
<p>

<h4>JavaScript</h4>
<p>I've used javascript during one of my course named User interface: Analysis and Conception(LOG2420). The final project was about creating a website using Google Maps Api that allow users to search informations related to some Canadian cities.
</p>

<h4>Git/Github</h4>
<p>I am  using Git as a version control software for most of my projects. For example my colleagues
   and I are using git for the most recent  project we are working on at the moment (a 3D game).
</p>


<h4>Automated testing (JUnit, phantomJS)</h4>
<p>I am taking a course named Test methods and Software validation(LOG3430).
The course talks about the importance of validation and verification in the software engineering
 process,  Strategies of Integration testing, Object oriented testing, Planning software testing activities are covered.
We are using java as a programming language and JUnit as a testing framework.
</p>

<h4>JavaDoc</h4>
<p>I've used JavaDoc to generate documentation on jenkins during my research project on release
  management. I'm also used Javadoc on all my program where java was is main programming language.

<p>The project where i've really experienced working whit large code bases are my two Major projects I and II.
 The first one was about building an autonomous robot using ATmega32 µcontroller. I was  member of a team of four people, and we had to design an autonomous robot, using ATMega32 µC and various sensors, that can follow a line by avoiding obstacles on it.
Tasks include :
<ul>
  <il> Assemble and weld the various components of the robot's motherboard</il>
  <il> Install sensors (sonar, infrared sensor, linetracking sensor) on the robot</il>
  <il>Program the robot using the C ++ programming language and AvrLibC library</il>
  <il>Perform hardware and software testing
</ul>
My role in a nutshell was to design an Object Oriented library which includes all the necessary features to control the robot.

The second one is about building a 3D Pinball game using C++ / C# and OpenGL.
Tasks include
<ul>
  <il>Design, implementation, validation and testing of an interactive graphics software system</il>
  <il>Integrated Technical concepts: Dynamics of rigid or articulated body, graphics, user interfaces, data structures and algorithms, object oriented programming and design, software testing<il>
</ul>
