<p>Nowadays, programming is everywhere. And I do believe that it is something everybody should know
  and deal with. To do so, it must be accessible.One of MIT App Inventor goal is to allows everyone,
   even novices, to experience and create fully functional apps. And that's a mission i care about.

<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Interest in App Inventor</h3>

<p>As a Mathematics and Computer science tutor at Polytechnic School of Montreal, my task is
  to help novices students who are uncomfortable with the basics of programmation, to better
  understand the materials covered in following classes: Procedural programming in C++ (INF1500C),
   Object-oriented programming in C++ (INF1010)..

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Proposed summer project.</h3>

<p>CDK (Component Developer Kit) is a project i find very interesting seeing that it will add
  more flexibility to the system. Sometime, users specifically experienced one, are stuck during
   there development because a feature they want to use is unavailable as a component.
   Having a Component Developer Kit will allow them to build their apps more efficiently.
   Furthermore, this can be a starting point for an open plugin store where developers can submit
    created components. This will allow users to have more choices when selecting a component and
    will allow them to create more diverse apps.
</p>
<p>However, this a task with multiple challenges seeing that it will increase the system complexity.
   All components created by users can work alone but interactions can sometimes cause a problem.
</p>

<p>I like working on challenging project like this one because that allow me to gain additional skills and make me discover my real potential. Otherwise, i am open to another project if the mentor thinks that it will be more suitable for my profile.

<h4>Java</h4>
<p>I've took more than 3 adavanced computer science courses where the main programming language was Java. I'm dealing also with java when i'm crafting some Android apps. I am also using Java in my research internship.

JavaScript
I've used javascript during one of my course named User interface: Analysis and Conception(LOG2420). The final project was about creating a website using Google Maps Api that allow users to search informations related to some Canadian cities.

Git/Github
I am  using Git as a version control software for most of my projects. For example my colleagues and I are using git for the most recent  project we are working on at the moment (a 3D game).


Automated testing (JUnit, phantomJS)
I am taking a course named Test methods and Software validation(LOG3430). The course talks about the importance of validation and verification in the software engineering process,  Strategies of Integration testing, Object oriented testing, Planning software testing activities are covered.
We are using java as a programming language and JUnit as a testing framework.


JavaDoc
I've used JavaDoc to generate documentation on jenkins during my research project on release management. I'm also used Javadoc on all my program where java was is main programming language.  </p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile.
